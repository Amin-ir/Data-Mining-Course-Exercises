# Data Mining Course Exercises - Algorithm Implementations in Python

This repository contains a collection of Jupyter notebooks developed as part of university tasks. These notebooks reflect an effort to manually implement algorithms for learning purposes. Coming from a background in C#, this project served as an opportunity to explore Python and understand the workings of various algorithms in detail.

## Contents
Each notebook focuses on a specific algorithm or task, showcasing:
- Manual implementation of algorithms
- Step-by-step breakdowns of the logic
- A focus on learning and exploring Python

### Topics Covered
- Data preprocessing: Binning algorithm to smooth noisy data & ChiMerge for converting continuous data into intervals.
- Frequent pattern mining: Apriori algorithm.
- Classification: Eager Learners such as Decision Tree, Naive Bayes & Lazy learning KNN.
- Clustering: Agglomerative Hierarchical Clustering, K-Means & DBSCAN algorithms.

## Purpose
The primary objective of this repository is to facilitate learning through practice. Instead of relying on pre-built libraries, the algorithms were implemented from scratch to:
- Understand Python programming better.
- Develop a deeper knowledge of algorithm design.
- Strengthen problem-solving skills.

## Usage
These notebooks are not production-ready and are intended solely for educational purposes. Note that:
- The code may lack optimization or professional formatting.
- Solutions prioritize clarity and learning over efficiency.

## Running the Notebooks
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
   ```
2. Install the necessary dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   (*Include a `requirements.txt` file if libraries like NumPy or Matplotlib are used.*)
3. Open the notebooks using Jupyter:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```
